          <h3>Main Info</h3>
          <p>
            One night in 2018, without a seat, Smudge stole one from a
            salad-eating guest. Claiming his place at the table, he wasn’t
            impressed with what was on the plate. In the now-famous image,
            Smudge -- ears tense and mouth ajar -- appears at once confused,
            revolted and dejected about the greens in front of him. “He only
            eats meat so I would have to say that he’s always hated vegetables,”
            said Stillabower. The image was originally posted to Tumblr in 2018,
            but became an internet sensation when a Twitter user in May combined
            it with a screenshot from a 2011 episode of The Real Housewives of
            Beverly Hills to become the “Woman Yelling at a Cat” meme. Both the
            images of Taylor Armstrong and Smudge were already widely used as
            reaction memes online, but together they became one of the most
            popular jokes on the internet.
